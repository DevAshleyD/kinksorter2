Kinksorter

The purpose of this program is to sort multiple movie storages together.

Movie is any video-file (Porn), which is uniquely taggable.
Storage means a number of videos, placed in a directory structure (Your Porn directory).
API means a way to assign each Movie properties by which it is identifiable by the Kinksorter and by a user.

== Sorted Storage ==
A sorted storage contains the directories of the APIs, by which a movie is tagged, which further
contain the movies in a structure best describing the specific APIs' sources' (Porn Site) organising structure.
- Sorting a sorted storage again should only analyse and sort the unsorted files of the Storage.

== Remote Storage ==
A remote storage is a Storage not yet sorted.
- It can be either writeable or not.
- It may require a plugin to get the Movies by.

= Movie =
A movie contains data to describe its file, its content and its API.
- The file properties describe the current file of the movie.
- The scene properties describe the content of the movie, by which it is (to be) sorted.
- The API describes the means to get the scene properties.

= Scene Properties =
A scene contains API-specific information to tag the movie.
A scene contains:
- a name given by the production.
- a date (when it's shot or when it's released)
- a number of performers (usually their names)
Often, a scene also contains:
- a specific subgenre
- an identifier

= File Properties =
To be able to locate the file, a movie contains:
- the full path, by which the file can be retrieved by a plugin (usually a file on disk)
- the file extension, to correctly build the sorted file with the scene information
- the relative path, after the root of the Storage the file is in.
